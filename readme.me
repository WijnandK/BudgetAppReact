This is the application build in the react course by Andrew Mead.
It teached me how too set up an react app without create-react-app,
Manually setting up babel and webpack.config gave me some interesting insights.
The expensify app makes use of some awesome Filtering algorithm's based on text, date & amount.
Together with moment() and AirBnB DatePickers this makes some powerfull tools wich i can now use and create in every future professional application.

Automated test suite. Written test cases with JEST
For improving the testing process for when the application grows
